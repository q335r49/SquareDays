## Track every minute of your life

**SquareDays** is a simple time logger for Android. This log is then painted onto a calendar display. It's for people who want to visualize how they *really* spent their day.

At present, it is currently in beta, but is being updated daily, as I test it out. :)

## Installation
 [APK Download](/apk)
 
## Directions
**Long press** an entry to modify it.

**Long press** the lower right box to add a new entry.

**Swipe right** on the lower right entry to view the calendar.

**Drag** an entry to modify start time and duration. 
* Drag it *horizontally* to log how long ago the task started.
* Drag it *vertically* to input an end time, and hence, mark a non-ongoing activity. 

For example: *I've been doing TASK since 15 minutes ago*, or, *An hour ago, I performed 30 minutes of TASK*.
